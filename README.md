In your reading notes page for this class, provide answers to the following prompts. Cite any external sources

1.  What's the difference between  `SQL`  and `NoSQL`?
*  SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and tables with logical links between them).
* NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL
2.  What is Sequelize and how to use it with Node js?
*Sequelize is  **a Node.**  **js-based Object Relational Mapper that makes it easy to work with MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL databases, and more**. An Object Relational Mapper performs functions like handling database records by representing the data as objects.* <br> <br>
3.  What is an ORM, how does it work, and how should I use one?
*An object-relational mapper **provides an object-oriented layer between relational databases and object-oriented programming languages without having to write SQL queries**. It standardizes interfaces reducing boilerplate and speeding development time*.
